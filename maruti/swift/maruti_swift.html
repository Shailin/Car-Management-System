                  <strong>August 30, 2016:</strong>
				 Maruti Suzuki had introduced the mid-life update of the second-generation Swift in the country in October 2014. The facelifted version came with subtle aesthetic improvements along with a few additional features – such as push-button engine start-stop, reverse parking sensors, electronically foldable outside rear-view mirrors, Bluetooth phone integration, and others – over the previous version. There were subtle changes to the front bumper as well; and it came with new upholstery.

                <div class="tabDetails">
                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
					<p>Maruti Suzuki has long occupied the top spot in the Indian auto space. Cars such as the Alto 800 and the Alto K10 captured the needs of the Indian masses. The Swift goes to show how the company excels in its understanding of the Indian market. This is a vehicle that has hit the right note with the Indian audiences, offering the right balance between quality and price. Released a few years ago, it has performed better in the market than most people back then would have foreseen, and we're here to examine all we can get about the vehicle to find out why.</p>                  
					<p>
                      <img src="images\maruti_swift_1.jpg"  >
                  </p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Its cost of ownership is reasonable. </p>
                    <p>2. Interior environment goes well with the masses. </p>


					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The legroom for the second row could be improved..</p>
                    <p>2. Its engine specs are inferior to class rivals.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The stereo system that comes along with radio and CD charger is a great ride bonus.</p>
                    
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>The Swift is offered in four variants, of both petrol and diesel trims. For the petrol version is a K-Series petrol engine, while on the diesel front is a 1248cc DDiS motor. Most people would find the interiors to be just what's needed, with some mediocre style that isn't overdone. Comfort is solidified with many functions ranging from adjustable seats, an accessory socket, power windows, Bluetooth system and many more. When you take stock of the vehicle and its reception, one can't help but think that this is just the type of model needed to pacify the Indian auto-stock every few years.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>We thought that the interiors were done up well, although some might feel that the space could have been improved. The front bench offers plenty of legroom, but taller members of our team felt slightly congested at the rear. Nevertheless, there is ample space for your head and shoulders in here.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\maruti_swift_2.jpg" >
                    </p>
					
					<p>There is a digital information display that gives out essential information about the car. A bit more towards the left and the centre console offers air vents with silver surrounds giving the cabin an up-market look. Entertainment system provided in VDi Swift definitely feels more premium which was there before and now has been added with Bluetooth connectivity while other features such as radio, CD player, USB are present as before.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\maruti_swift_3.jpg" >
                    </p>

					<p>Besides these features, we would like to add that the top end variant ZDi features a Start Stop Button with automatic climate control for the matter of convenience to the end user. Although Swift diesel comes with fabric seats, the test vehicle that we got featured a combination of red, black and silver leatherette on it. Blending in almost perfectly was the red and black steering cover which happens to be an aftermarket fitment.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
