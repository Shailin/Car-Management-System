					The Government has reduced the duty on electric and hybrid cars in Delhi. As a result the diesel variants of the Ertiga have witnessed a price drop of upto Rs. 62,000. The diesel variants of the Ertiga come equipped with SHVS technology which gives the car features like engine idle start/stop and brake energy regeneration. This qualifies the Ertiga as a hybrid car. The Ertiga’s base variant was priced at Rs. 7.59 lakh earlier, but now costs Rs. 7.08 lakh. The top variant was priced at Rs. 9.28 lakh and is now available for Rs. 8.66 lakh. This price drop is limited only to Delhi.

              <h2>Maruti Suzuki Ertiga Review</h2>
              <span class="holder">&nbsp;</span>
                <div class="tabDetails">
                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
				<p>The compact utility vehicle segment was almost non-existent till the introduction of the Maruti Suzuki Ertiga in 2012. Unlike conventional UVs, the Ertiga felt, looked and drove like a car, which also became the recipe for its success. The carmaker called it the LUV (Life Utility Vehicle), an offering targeted at urban families looking for three rows in compact dimensions.  </p>
				  <p>
                      <img src="images\maruti_ertiga_1.jpg">
                  </p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Competent engines that offer good fuel economy. The diesel churns out 24.52kmpl and the petrol, 17.5kmpl.</p>
                    <p>2. For a 7-seater utility vehicle, the car has great road manners.</p>

					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The second row does not tumble down, making it difficult to get in and out of the third row.</p>
                    <p>2. With all three rows up, the boot space stands at 135-litres. You have to choose between extra passengers or their luggage</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The nifty storage box in the boot makes it easy to organize knick-knacks. </p>
                    <p>2. Third-row passengers get 3-point seatbelts as opposed to lap belts</p>
					
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>Ertiga competes with the Toyota Innova, Mahindra Xylo, Tata Sumo Grande, Toyota Avanza, Honda Mobilio, Renault Lodgy and Nissan Grand Livina. This car is powered by K-series 1.4 litre petrol engine. A diesel version of this car is powered by Fiat's 1.3 litre Multijet engine. The car is based on extended Suzuki Swift platform. This means that the Ertiga is a monocoque MPV; the first in India. </p>                    
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>The Ertiga’s cabin is familiar, but gets a few differentiators. While the dash design and the whole cabin layout is similar to the Swift and DZire, the colour scheme is entirely different. It gets a mix of beige and brown instead of the black and beige combination of the Dzire and the Swift’s all-black.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\maruti_ertiga_2.jpg" >
                    </p>
					
					<p>The 3-spoke steering is great to hold and gets controls for telephony, audio and voice assist that can be operated by the left thumb. The instrument panel is similar to the Swift and includes a tachometer, speedometer, temperature and fuel gauge, a small LCD display, and space for warning lights inside it. The top-spec Ertiga even has an engine start/stop button.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\maruti_ertiga_3.jpg" >
                    </p>

					<p>The seats are comfortable and offer good under-thigh support. With all 7 seats in place, the luggage space can hold just two regular bags. Alongside this, there’s a concealed storage bay hidden beneath, which can hold small items. In case you are wondering where the Ertiga’s spare wheel manages some space for itself, it’s mounted under the body, as with most MPVs.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
