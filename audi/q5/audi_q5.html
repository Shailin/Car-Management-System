					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>After a successful 2012, Audi began the New Year with the launch of the refreshed Q5. This mid-size luxury SUV has been around for a while and it needed some upgrades as the competitors have introduced new models or facelift.Audi has been spot-on with its designing cues and also the product line-up for India. The refresh version of the Q5 gets some cosmetic changes that enrich its existing design characteristics. The new single frame grille does remind of the A8 L that makes it look 3-dimensional.</p>                    
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>Interior styling of the Q5 have always been lounge-like and Audi has retained this styling. Different exterior colours get different interior trims, and depending on the colour of your Q5, the interiors will be decided.The quality of plastic and the fit and finish are as per Audi standard. The range of standard fitment is good as the Q5 now gets satellite navigation, along with Audiâ€™s MMI, reverse parking camera and other fitments.</p>
					<p>

                    </p>
					
					<p>The seats on the Q5 are large and also comfortable, also the leather is also well augmented. The space in both the rows is sufficient with enough large room and headroom.The front seats are electrically adjustable, however the thigh support on the rear seats is decent, although we wish it could have been better.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\audi_q5_3.jpg" >
                    </p>

					<p>You can also set the Q5 as per your requirement. It has comfort, dynamic, auto and individual setting. The comfort mode is preferred when you are cruising on the highway or driving in the city. In this set-up, the steering is light and the suspension is soft. In dynamic, the suspension is stiffened, the gearbox, throttle and the steering is more responsive. In auto mode, the computers decides the ideal setting, while in individual one can tailor the set-up as per needs in each of the department.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
