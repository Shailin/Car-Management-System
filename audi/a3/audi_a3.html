                  <strong>September 2, 2015:</strong>
				Audi India has introduced new A3 40 TFSI Premium sedan for Rs. 25.50 lac (ex-showroom Delhi / Mumbai). The Premium Plus variant which costed Rs 30.2 lac has now been discontinued making 40 TFSI Premium the only petrol variant in the A3 range. Under the hood of the Audi, powering the front wheels is a 1.8-litre petrol engine which manages to produce 178bhp and 250Nm of torque. Power delivery is handled by a seven-speed dual-clutch S-Tronic gearbox which propels the car from a standstill to 100 km/h in 7.3 seconds. The Audi music interface allows portable media players to connect into MMI which enables customers to select albums, artists, genres or tracks with the MMI controls.

                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
					<p>As the festive season is fast approaching, several car manufacturers are lining up models to increase their numbers. Following suit, Audi India has introduced the base variant of their most affordable sedan, Audi A3. It has discontinued the only existing petrol trim '40TFSI Premium Plus' and replaced it with the new '40 TFSI Premium' version. Currently, it is the only TFSI version in the entire line-up and is priced almost 5 lakhs lower than the discontinued version. Because of this alteration in its price tag, it does lose out on some aspects. But, at the same time, it is incorporated with a newly designed set of 16-inch alloy wheels instead of the earlier 17-inch rims and also halogen lamps in place of xenon lights. It also gets parking sensors, but without a display.</p>

                  </p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Eye catching exteriors with striking aspects.</p>
                    <p>2. Safety standards are up to the mark and Availability of innovative comfort features. </p>


					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Its low ground clearance is a major drawback.</p>
                    <p>2. Its oil burner's noise and vibrations should be controlled.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Full-fledged version of connectivity and Multi Media Interface system and 4G LTE Wi-Fi connection are the notable features of this sedan.   </p>
                    
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>Audi India is the largest luxury car maker at the moment, as it became the first automaker to cross the 10,000 units mark in this range of manufacturers. While competition is introducing higher-end cars, Audi becomes the first automaker to introduce a compact sedan for our market.The A3 follows the new design language of the Audis. The string of LEDs have now been replaced by a smooth LED fluid that we have seen on the A4, A6 and the RS 5. The LED has been become thinner and there is a variant with only halogen lamps and no LEDs.</p>                    
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>The outside styling of the A3 isn't very different from the conventional Audi styling, however the instrument panel has been redesigned. It boasts a brand new key design to begin with, and a majority of the elements have been changed on the inside, except for the four-spoke steering wheel.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\audi_a3_2.jpg" >
                    </p>
					
					<p>There are these new circular air-con vents that diffuse and concentrate the air at one point. There is a simple adjustment on them. Then there is also the new MMI system, with touch pad on the knob and redesigned air-conditioning controls that are a lot simpler to operate despite being dual zone.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\audi_a3_3.jpg" >
                    </p>

					<p>One very important aspect for us Indians is the space. The front row seats are large and comfortable with loads of head room and leg room for front row passengers with good back support and could be better side support. In the second row the knee room is tight for tall people, and the thigh support is just fine. The boot is surprisingly large than what it looks from the outside.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
