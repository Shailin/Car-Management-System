                  <strong>October 17, 2016:</strong>
					The Chevrolet Cruze facelift was launched in India ahead of the 2016 Auto Expo at Rs 14.68 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi). Soon, after a few weeks, the Cruze's prices were slashed and it now starts at Rs 13.95 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi). Speaking of the major additions in the 2016 Chevrolet Cruze, the updated sedan offers new grille, daytime running LEDs, projector fog lamps and seven-inch MyLink infotainment system, among others. Mechanically, the 2016 Cruze remains unchanged with the 2.0-litre VCDi diesel engine that produces 166PS of power along with 380Nm of torque and comes with an option of a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic gearbox. 			</div>

                <div class="tabDetails">
                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
					<p>It's safe to say that the vehicle does boast some unique impressions of its own, from a stylish look to a luxurious cabin to passable performance. Chrome highlights, an agile shape and a well balanced profile together make the Cruze gracious and good looking. Underneath the skin, it comes with a mediocre cabin that is treated for a lush and engaging appeal. The black and titanium colour scheme makes for a holistic aura, and occupants are sure to feel enriched by the modern and sophisticated layout of the instruments. </p>                  
					<p>
                      <img src="images\chevrolet_cruze_1.jpg"  >
                  </p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Stunning exterior look.</p>
                    <p>2. Host of comfort and entertainment facilities to keep the occupants engaged.</p>


					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The performance could use an upgrade.</p>
                    <p>2.  Its price range is sure to trim its column of potential buyers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
					<p>1. The My-Link 7-inch Infotainment System is one of the few things that truly awe you about this car.</p>                    
					<p>2. Its handling is particularly good, giving just about any type of driver the time of his life.</p>     
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>Cruze is back and better than ever. The new dual-port chrome grille front fascia, and a balanced tail light design on the rear enhance the sculptural lines of the Cruze, while a wide chrome bar on the upper rear bumper creates a more sophisticated look. Projection fog lamps and LED daytime running lights add to the appearance while improving safety. These aesthetic enhancements take the Cruze to the next level in design and detailing.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>The cabin is reasonably spacious, and when placed aside rival sedans, it probably goes a notch or two up. Taller and broader occupants could have mild complaints, but all in all, the machine can comfortably house five normal adults. For the front occupants, there is decent space for you to stretch your legs, while the rear could use some more. Headroom does fall short slightly, and if you're in a taller range, you might have to put up with a constricted feeling.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\chevrolet_cruze_2.jpg" >
                    </p>
					
					<p>Being a Chevy vehicle, you're more than justified in seeking the most sensuous, luxurious appeal in here. We'll let you know that we felt marvellous sitting in here. The Corvette inspired dual cockpit design had our jaws dropping and the premium black and titanium wraparound theme further instilled some beauty into the space.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\chevrolet_cruze_3.jpg" >
                    </p>

					<p>The steering wheel comes with the same sporty design that most vehicles employ today, but we've got to add that it felt remarkably good to hold. Buttons for the audio system, Bluetooth, voice recognition as well as cruise control have been wired into the wheel, and the Chevrolet emblem rests by the centre for a more distinctive image.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
