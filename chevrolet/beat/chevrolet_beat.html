                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
				<p>Chevrolet Beat is one of the best selling hatchbacks available in the country's automobile market. It is a small yet stylish vehicle that can easily accommodate five people. Recently, the manufacturer has added a Manchester United Limited Edition with an exclusive set of interior and exterior aspects. The outsides are decorated with sporty decals along with Manchester United logo, which gives it a dynamic look. The insides too get a few updates like plush black carpet mats, special seat covers and illuminated scuff plates. The remaining options are bestowed with a pleasant internal cabin that has a blue illuminated instrument panel equipped with several notifications. </p>

                  </p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Economical price range is an added advantage.</p>
                    <p>2. Availability in two engine options.</p>


					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Lesser cabin space is a big disadvantage.</p>
                    <p>2. No automatic transmission to choose from.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Funky Instrument Cluster and Steering Audio Control </p>
                    <p>2. SMARTECH Engine</p>
					
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>Chevrolet Beat has always been a successful model for General Motors in our country. After charming the audience by acting in 'Transformers' as a small peppy 'Autobot', the Beat was launched with radical looks and frugal engines. But the market has been flooded with other alternatives by several manufacturers since. For the year 2014, Chevrolet has given a slight facelift to keep the buzz going for the Beat. We spend a couple of days with this handsome hatch to see what's what.</p>                    
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>The cabin of the Beat is a nice place to be. There are fewer lines and more curves all around. We like the blue backlit on all the controls and toggles on the dashboard. Chevrolet has added new steering mounted controls, which lets you take control of the audio system. Plastics are of decent quality and built tough for rugged use. You get air conditioning, an audio system with AUX IN/USB/CD and four speakers. The driver's seat gives you a good view of the road ahead and a smooth light steering wheel for ease.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\chevrolet_beat_2.jpg" >
                    </p>
					
					<p>The feather light steering, comfortable driving position and an engine tuned to return maximum fuel efficiency is not the recipe for sporty performance, but this little hatch is still fun to drive. The gas charged suspension setup has been tampered with at the rear to improve upon driving characteristics. The ride quality is better now with a knack for quick cornering as well. The gear lever is a boring plastic stick which needs to improve immediately. The acceleration is going to pin you in the seat but what really stands out is the capability of the Beat to remain planted and sure-footed at triple digit speeds. </p>

                    </p>

					<p>It is bestowed with an audio unit that has four speakers. The base model has no inbuilt provision for audio unit, but customers can definitely get it fixed. It has space for speakers with surround sound effect that results in a pleasant and enjoyable journey. An in-dash integrated ice-blue lit music system is available with full-size USB allows audio streaming and has several enhanced sound quality setting options for those in the top range. Their limited edition option also has this unit, which even supports Bluetooth connectivity.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
