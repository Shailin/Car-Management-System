                  <strong>September 06,2016:</strong>
                   Honda Cars India had introduced its most economical offering - the Brio - in the year 2011. The hatchback borrowed its petrol engine from the Jazz- 1.2-litre i-VTEC petrol. The motor puts out 88PS of max power and 109Nm of peak torque in the Brio and is mated to a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission. The latter was introduced a year after the launch of the hatchback. The Brio competes with vehicles such as the Hyundai Grand i10, the Maruti Suzuki Swift, the Ford Figo, the Tata Tiago, among others. It is long due for a mid-life update considering the Amaze (compact sedan based on the Brio) also received the facelift earlier this year. Well, the face-lifted Brio has been spotted recently at a dealership and is expected to be launched in coming weeks ahead of the upcoming festive season.

              <h2> Honda Brio Review</h2>

                <div class="tabDetails">
                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
                    Honda has found a perfect haven here in India. The company's models are tailored to meet the needs of the general masses, and most of them fared well in the market. The Brio was launched five years back, and since then, it's risen to a good position in the market, so that today most people glimpse the vehicle on their street. Designed with a unique and compact presence, the car invokes a persona never seen in a vehicle before. As we delve through the many sides of the machine, we'd have ample room to find out where it stands out and where it could do better.

                      <img src="images\Honda_brio1.png"  >
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                  <p>1. Handling is very good.</p>
                  <p>2. Many strong comfort features within.</p>

                   <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Some might find the cabin small and cramped.</p>
                    <p>2. Most of the good features are not present in the low end trims.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The Integrated Honda Audio system comes along with radio facility, MP3, USB, Aux-In and many more functions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
                    The vehicle is designed with the purpose of satisfying the varying needs of an average Indian consumer. Powering the machine is a 1.2-litre petrol engine that displaces 1198cc. The engine combines decent performance with a good fuel economy, slotting a mileage of 19.4kmpl. The engine prowess is balanced by a robust chassis, along with many sound safety elements. Coming to the outside, we thought the car's design was fascinating, but some might find the fresh new theme odd. Some plush features animate the look, such as chrome touches, black window frames, and the fine curves. The interior has been given a serene atmosphere. The interaction of the colors and materials in the place makes a more dynamic air. The higher end variants come with a slew of good features, from a radio system to power windows, adjustable seating, an air conditioner with a heater and many more.&nbsp;

                    <p><strong>Exteriors:</strong></p>
                    The car makes its mark with a small and compact body profile, which has also been honed for a racy edge. We thought that the well sculpted wheel arches, neat body lines and agile posture together gave the machine a bold demeanor.&nbsp;

                    </p>


                    <p>When you take a look at the rear side of the vehicle, you feel a more distinguished pulse in the look. The tail region looks unlike any other we've seen before. </p>
                    <p>
                      <img src="images\Honda_Brio_RS.png"  >
                    </p>

                    <p>The large rear window at the center and the small tail-lamps by the corner are perfectly aligned. The lower portion of the rear is broader and heavier, and we thought this did spell an odd feel for the image at the rear. </p>
