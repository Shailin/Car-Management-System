                  <strong>September 06,2016:</strong>
					Honda is expected to launch the next generation of the Amaze sedan by mid-2018. The India bound version will show reworked interiors and exteriors and also upgrade safety equipment. The company recently introduced a facelift for its compact sedan priced from INR 5.29 to 8.19 lakhs (Ex-showroom, New Delhi). The car has a new front/rear bumper, reworked radiator grille and new taillights on outside and a new dual-theme dashboard with an automatic climate control system inside. Engine wise, it retains the same 1.2-litre i-VTEC petrol and the 1.5-litre i-DTEC diesel engines. The new Amaze also gets a new CVT transmission option and dual front airbags as a standard feature.                </p>

                <div class="tabDetails">
                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
                  <p>The Amaze started a new phase for Honda in India. The diesel phase to be precise. The compact sedan was the first car to introduce the i-DTEC motor to the market. Though Honda was producing some pretty good cars, their petrol-only portfolio was losing to the diesel alternatives of the competition. Honda also needed to take advantage of the lucrative compact sedan segment, so what better way to introduce a brand first? The Amaze also received a facelift, which corrected some of the drawbacks of the first generation model.</p>
                  <p>
                      <img src="images\honda_amaze1.png"  >
                  </p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Honda's reliability and powerfull engine for the segment.</p>
                    <p>2. One of the most fuel efficient diesel cars in the country (25.8kmpl).p>


					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Amaze's diesel has poor NVH level management.</p>
                    <p>2. Dashboard though better than before, still isn't as upmarket as some rivals</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. CVT Automatic Transmission  </p>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>The Amaze was pretty much a landmark car for Honda in India. It was a car that was born out of government regulations that forced Honda to make the Amaze the way it is. Honda's entry into the cut-throat compact sedan segment was also Honda's first diesel offering in India. After selling 2 lakh units since its launch in 2013, Honda has finally decided to give it a much-deserved facelift.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>If there was one part about the Amaze that was one of its biggest Achilles heels, it had to be the interiors. The Amaze was (and still is) one of the most spacious cars in its class, but the overall design was pretty bland. Honda tried sprucing it up by adding a big display touch screen unit, but that wasn't of much help.</p>                    
					<p>
                      <img src="images\honda_amaze2.jpg" >
                    </p>
					<p>The moment you get inside the new car though, you see a refreshing change. The entire dashboard has been re-designed and it looks pretty good.  It's a very cohesive design and nothing looks out of place. The black and beige dual tone combo remains with classy silver inserts all around.</p>                    
					<p>
                      <img src="images\honda_amaze3.jpg" >
                    </p>

					<p>Finally, as you move your eyes towards the speedo console, you see some more changes. Firstly, the steering gets audio mounted controls. The speedo console has been borrowed from the current City and now gets a multi information display which gives out the range, average fuel consumption, instantaneous fuel efficiency, time and the ambient temperature.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
