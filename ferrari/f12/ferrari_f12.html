                  </p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Well crafted interior and cabin as well.</p>
                    <p>2. Exteriors are crafted with the highest elegance and beauty.</p>


					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The refined craft of its exterior leaves its interior suffering, with lesser space.</p>
                    <p>2.  It is among the most expensive vehicles ever.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The 6262cc V12 features the same bore and stroke as the four-wheel drive FF, but the bottom end is new, plus the top end has been extensively re-worked, says Maranello. </p>
                    
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>This company has a name that has set ablaze the trials of automotive history. This is a massive player in the sports car, field possibly among history's best brands ever. It has carved a unique, undefinable place for itself. With engineering refined and honed for precision over the course of almost a century, this car brand has set its levels to the highest in the world. It stands for excellence among the field that no other company of the day, except perhaps one or two, have ever rivaled. Among its overly appraised range of cars is the Ferrari F12Berlinetta , a machine paving the way for the sports car world of tomorrow. </p>                    
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>The ground-breaking performance level that the car is suited for, does not, by any means, leave its interior degraded in the quality it is meant to give. The low and sharp build of the machine does not take a heavy toll on the inside, with the cabin space still large and lavishly coated. </p>
					<p>

                    </p>

Fine material layer the inside of the cabin, immersing it in the most luxurious of atmospheres. The seats are covered in flawlessly stitched, premium leather. The steering wheel is also formatted for the very best feel, allowing function to merge with style. It is made of carbon fiber, and covered with premium leather. </p>

                    </p>
