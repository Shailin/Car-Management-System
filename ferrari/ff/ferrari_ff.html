                  <strong>October 31, 2011:</strong>
					Ferrari FF, the grand supercar is officially launched today in New Delhi. Priced at Rs 3.42 crore, this super car has got this name due to its 4 wheel drive and seating capacity for four people. This series which was already brought by this company India earlier this year has now been formally launched by the Italian car maker so as to encourage its sale tooth and nail. The supercar is grabbing attention due to the Grand Prix event which concluded just recently in India and which saw a lot of adrenalin-pumping action by smashingly performing sportscars.

                <div class="tabDetails">
                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
				<p>This company is a name that has blazed on the trials of automotive history. Here is a company that has carved a unique, undefinable place for itself. It is a unique brand in that, it has pioneered all new innovations to the realm of sports cars, setting the standards a new and making itself a leader in the field, who has stood for the very finest excellence among car making for the span of a century. Among its overly appraised range of cars is the Ferrari FF, a machine of tongue watering grandeur. This is a machine built for massiveness on every scale of its production, from its high-tech infrastructure to its low and amazing profile.</p>
				  <p>
                      <img src="images\ferrari_ff_1.jpg"  >
                  </p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Exteriors are crafted with the highest elegance and beauty. </p>
                    <p>2. A good mileage is also delivered for the kind of performance capacity.</p>


					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. It has low ground clearance.</p>
                    <p>2. Its price range makes it one of the most expensive cars ever made.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Ferrari FF is the first model to feature Apple CarPlay [video]</p>
                    
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>The FF is a four-seat, four-wheel drive (hence the name) 'shooting brake' which means that it's a bit like a cross between a coupe and an estate car. Two doors, four proper seats, Ferrari's first ever production 4x4 system; the FF really is a departure for the Italian marque, and a success for all that. Powered by a front mid-mounted 6.2-litre, 660bhp V12, the FF replaces the 612 Scaglietti as the Ferrari GT of choice. </p>                    
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>The ground-breaking performance level that the car is suited for, does not, by any means, leave its interior degraded in the quality it is meant to give. The low and sharp build of the machine does not take a heavy toll on the inside, with the cabin space still large and lavishly coated. The Italian manufacturer has always meant to deliver luxury of the most refined sort, and with this model, they take to a new level. </p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\ferrari_ff_2.jpg" >
                    </p>
					
					<p>The most decoration of the cabin is savored only for the most expensive and unique of material. Premium leather upholstery cover the seats, made and examined for flawlessness on every seam. Rich leather also covers the steering wheel, enabling not only a firmer grip, but a most luxurious aura to bask in, while driving this machine. The interior kit, seat shell, and the dashboard kit are made of carbon fiber. </p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\ferrari_ff_3.jpg" >
                    </p>

					<p>The interior kit also has a neo piano design, meant to uplift its passengers to the heights of elegance. The e-gears are available in multiple colors and designs, with the company's inscription on all of them. Carbon fiber floor mats are available in different color stitches, all of them made for the most homely atmosphere a machine could possibly give.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
