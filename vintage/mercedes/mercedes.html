              		The 1954 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL. Back then the most innovative sports car in the world.
					It was iconic before it had even been built: as a racing car the 300 SL finished the 1952 24 Hours of Le Mans with a one-two victory. 
					It was immortalised for ever more later that same year, when it was also first to cross the finishing line at the murderous Carrera Paname ricana in Mexico. After that, everyone wanted it: from Pablo Picasso to Sophia Loren and Henri Nannen – hardly anyone could resist the production version of this super sports car with its novel gullwing doors. 
					They were all filled with enthusiasm by what was undoubtedly the most spectacular way of getting into a car – if not exactly the most comfortable.

                <div class="tabDetails">
                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
					<p>The 300 SL Gullwing is an automobile from Mercedes-Benz, with rear wheel drive, a front located engine and a Friedrich Geiger-designed 2 door coupe body style. The 300 SL Gullwing is part of Mercedes-Benz's W 198 I series of cars.Mercedes-Benz described it as their "response to the demand in many countries for a particularly fast, comfortable, open sports car. This automobile offers a wide range of technical achievements for even greater driving safety and motoring comfort as well as a high standard of practical everyday value for touring in real style."</p>

                  </p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Looks-Older Mercedes-Benz cars still look sharp and get attention even when they are five or ten years old.</p>
                    <p>2. Mercedes-Benz cars provide a comfortable, safe and luxurious ride quality.  </p>


					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The maintenance cost on a used Mercedes-Benz can be much higher than that of a non-luxury brand. </p>
                    <p>2. Mercedes-Benz may be useless if the maps aren't updated.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. The 300SL is generally considered to be the first supercar, a racer-turned-production machine capable of hitting 160 mph in an era when 100 was a stretch.</p>
                    
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>The Mercedes-Benz 300SL gullwing is one of the most beautiful classic cars of all time.The Mercedes-Benz 300 SL (W198) was the first iteration of the SL-Class grand tourer and fastest production car of its day. Introduced in 1954 as a two-seat coupe with distinctive gull-wing doors, it was later offered as an open roadster.</p>                    
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>Like the Gullwing, the Roadster featured roughly the same engineering underneath, but the body was changed to incorporate regular doors. Detail differences included larger front fenders, larger 'euro' headlights, a smaller grille, a rounder front windscreen and a chrome accent strip running down the side of the car.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\mercedes_2.jpg" >
                    </p>
					
					<p>To maintain rigidity , Mercedes-Benz engineers had to add more structural integrity into the chassis. Thus the Roadster is slightly heavier than its coupe counterpart. The rear suspension was also revised with a single-point swing axle and an additional coil spring.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\mercedes_3.jpg" >
                    </p>

					<p>The engine was only slightly updated to include a sports camshaft and a higher 9.5:1 compression ratio. This helped the car achieve a top speed near 155 mph. Like the Coupe, the Roadster was available with a wide array of options, some of the more desirable include the hardtop, knock-off Rudge wheels and fitted rear luggage.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
