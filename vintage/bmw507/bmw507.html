              		That's the BMW 507, all right: Rare, beautiful, and quite valuable. Pristine examples have recently sold at auction for over $2,300,000; quite a bump from their original price of around $10,500. Even ordinary examples can command prices up to $1,500,000.
					Only 252 BMW 507s were built from 1956 to 1959. The most famous is probably the one leased by Elvis Presley and formerly driven by Hans Stuck the elder. That 507 is currently in the possession of BMW Classic to be restored.

                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
					<p>The condition of the two-seater really was a cause for concern. Although the original body parts and other components were virtually all present and intact, the roadster had lost its engine and gearbox. The rear axle was a “replacement part” of unknown origin, rust was eating away the floor assembly, the seats were worn and there was no instrument panel. However, the fascination of a rare and beguilingly beautiful automobile outweighed all the inadequacies and deficiencies, augmented by the memory of Elvis Presley and his greatest hits.</p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Gorgeous, probably the best-looking BMW ever</p>
                    <p>2. Series II models are also very comfortable </p>


					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Too expensive when it was new, horrifyingly expensive now.</p>
                    <p>2. Power is just decent.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Exactly what a ’50s European roadster should be</p>
                    
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>The body of the 507 is made of aluminum and was hand formed. This means that no 2 cars are quite the same, although they’re obviously very similar. This does mean that the handful of cars that were sold with removable hardtops were custom made, and each hardtop will fit only the specific car it was made for. The design itself is by Albrecht von Goertz, a German who had emigrated to the U.S. prior to WWII. Since this was a German car being made for the American market, he was a logical choice to pen the design. Goertz would also design the 503, but it is the 507 that is generally considered his greatest work. </p>                    
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>There are two different interiors for the 507, with this being the primary difference between the Series I and Series II cars. The Series II provided a lot more interior space, something BMW quickly realized the car needed. For this reason, only 35 units of the Series I were produced before BMW made the redesign. This car is a Series II, which despite being not as rare, is generally the more desirable version of the car. It’s obvious from looking at that the 507 was made to be a luxurious car. This one has a red interior to contrast with the black body and body-matching dash. It looks good in a very ’50s kind of way.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\bmw507_2.jpg" >
                    </p>
					
					<p>The engine would live on for a little while after the debacle of the 503/507, eventually getting up to 160 horsepower. But the engine uses pushrods, and BMW wanted to move to a more sophisticated overhead cam design, so it was retired in 1965. It wasn’t a terrible amount of power for the time, but with the high price that ended up being attached to the car, it ceased to be competitive in its segment.</p>

                    </p>

					<p>Front suspension was parallel double wishbones, with torsion bar springs and an anti-roll bar. Rear suspension had a live axle, also sprung by torsion bars, and located by a Panhard rod and a central, transverse A-arm to control acceleration and braking forces. Brakes were Alfin drum brakes of 284.5 mm (11.2 in) diameter, and power brakes were optional. Late-model 507s had front Girling disc brakes.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
