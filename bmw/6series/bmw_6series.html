                  <p> <strong>Overall:</strong></p>
				<p>BMW India, the completely owned subsidiary of the foremost luxury car brand from Germany has introduced the facelifted version of its premium vehicle BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe. In the year 2013, it had received a few cosmetic tweaks to its exteriors. Now again, the company has updated its exteriors making it sleek yet bold in its class. It gets new set of LED headlamps along with a refined radiator grille and a revised front bumper. This latest version now gets full LED lights as standard fitment, which emphasizes its refreshing new appearance. The design of the side and rear facets seems to be the same, but the updated alloy wheels gives it an extraordinary appeal. The manufacturer made no changes to the interior design, but has covered the seats with two-tone leather upholstery. Apart from this, all its other features are retained from the outgoing model. </p>

                  </p>

					<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
					<p>1. Refurbished exterior design is stunning. </p>
                    <p>2. Inclusion of memory function to seats add to its advantage.</p>


					<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. Bang and Olufsen sound system can be given as a standard feature.</p>
                    <p>2. Boot compartment is not as spacious as other contenders.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stand-Out Features:</strong></p>
                    <p>1. With its sweeping roofline and muscular stance, the Gran Coupe disguises a pair of rear doors while retaining the sporty fa√ßade of the two-door on which it is based. A 315-hp 3.0-liter turbo inline-six or 445-hp 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 power the rear or all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic. </p>
                    
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
					<p>Convertibles or topless cars are not a very familiar sight for Indian roads; very few car makers have got their convertibles to India, an addition being the BMW 650i. Let's get a bit on the history of the BMW 6 Series first. The initial BMW 6 Series was launched in the year 1976, based on the E 12 and E 28 5Series of that time. Since then BMW has been producing the 6 Series as a two-door convertible and two-door coupe. We get behind the wheel of the latest BMW in town, the 650i Convertible, and take it through its paces to find out all that's there in this two-door, four-seater topless car costing more than a crore. Join us as we explore the BMW 650i.</p>                    
					
					<p><strong>Interiros:</strong></p>
					<p>The BMW 650i, owing to its large proportions, has a huge cabin space that's mainly driver-oriented. Reddish-brown leather upholstery is given, although you also have an option of choosing between ivory white or an all black shade of leather. Front seats are all electric and have settings for height, reach, tilt lumber, and also a seat extension for under-thigh support that also works electrically.</p>
					<p>
                      <img src="images\bmw_6series_2.jpg" >
                    </p>
					
					<p>We touched whooping 100-kmph mark in a mere 5.3 seconds, which is real quick and that too for a car this huge. We zoomed for a long time touching 190 kmph at times and the engine was every obedient and quick during overtakes. Floor the pedal and your head hits the headrest and in a wink when you are doing 100 kmph plus speeds. Near instant pickup is what is experienced in this speed beauty and the pleasure is unmatched when you drive with the soft top folded down. The wind noise is cut out smartly by some efficient aerodynamic design engineering. The 650i has a nice and stable handling as with all BMW cars, the steering is perfect to what you desire and keeps the driver in command at all speeds</p>

                      <img src="images\bmw_6series_3.jpg" >
                    </p>

					<p>The car corners superbly as any other BMW. The driving dynamics are unmatched and driving a topless car (open roof) gives a pleasure that cannot be put into words easily, it's something that brings a wide grin on your face automatically and the grin is there till the drive ends. You can toggle between the drive modes, that is, Normal, Sport, and Sport+ where the gear ratios and the chassis, suspension, and steering feedback are altered according to the mode you choose.</p>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
