					BMW is to launch a facelift for its i8 model by end 2017. The hybrid sports car will get upgrades in powertrain, chassis and overall design. While the current 1.5-litre turbo petrol mill coupled to an electric motor generates 362hp, the updated combination is likely to churn out 425 horses. This is approximately 18 per cent increase in power. The German carmaker is likely to introduce the induction charging option also in the facelift. Apart from this, it will focus on weight reduction by using carbon-fibre tyres instead of aluminium ones.

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
